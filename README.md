This repository contains the code for an imitation learning model and the DAgger algorithm for the CarRacing-v2 Gym Environment. 

This is part of the [MassAI](https://discord.com/invite/47e96wJEVK) Beginner's Lecture Series. Lecture on Imitation Learning was on 11/06/2024.

This repository took inspiration from [https://github.com/kvgarimella/dagger](https://github.com/kvgarimella/dagger), even though this repository is deprecated and will not work for updated Gym versions.

DAgger helps the imitation learning agent learn correct actions when following sub-optimal trajectories:

Check out [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sross1/publications/Ross-AIStats11-NoRegret.pdf) to learn more about DAgger.
